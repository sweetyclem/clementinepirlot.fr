					<p>Currently studying development, I am dedicated to coding and helping other women join the tech sector. I have also been admitted to IT school 42 and will start there in 2017.
					My career has always been punctuated with technology and a great journey towards becoming a developer.<br>
					<br>
					Having studied English literature and Anglophone civilizations for 3 years, I had the opportunity to study abroad and spent a year in Long Beach, Ca, where I wrote a dissertation on working women in 1940's Hollywood. I discovered that as technology became prevalent in the film industry, women were pushed out of jobs such as directing and editing.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>When I came back to France, I chose to pursue a Sociology of gender master's degree. For two years I studied women in a French computer science school. The IT sector has always seemed attractive to me and during my experiences working for non profits I was always the tech savvy one, as I liked to solve problems, configure and maintain when necessary.
					After seven month being a project coordinator at Social Builder, helping women go towards the digital sector, telling women they can code, and that technology is accessible to everyone, the question came naturally, why not me&#8239;? </p>
					<br>
					<p>I then started taking every course on <a class="pages" href="https://www.codecademy.com/sweetyclem" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and love it so much I decided to make it a career. I have been working since I started university and have always worked while getting my<a class="pages" href="education.html">education</a>. My various<a class="pages" href="experiences.html">experiences</a> made me acquire many <a class="pages" href="capabilities.html">skills</a> that are my strength and make me a very literate geek. My dedication to code is sustained by a rich life with many <a class="pages" href="interests.html">interests</a> that allow me to contribute in this world and be happy !</p>
